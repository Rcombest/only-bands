# Only-Bands: It's Not Only Bands (Songs and Albums Too)!

Only-Bands is an app for more than just bands! A feature available to guests and users allows for the viewing of the "Current User Fav's" page, which allows users to input current songs and artists they've had playing on repeat. Guests are able to view this list as well, but are unable to add to it without first signing-in through their Google account. Once signed-in, users are able to input new songs to the current favorites page, as well as edit a song in the event that a new favorite jam from the same artist takes the place in their heart that the old song once held. Users are also able to delete song/artist combinations they added to the current user favorites page. If signed-in, users are able to navigate to the profiles page, and click on their own profile to make a list of favorite bands, as well as naming an album by the band, and the genre of music. Similar to the current favorites page, users are able to edit the albums in their lists if a different album by the same band starts to edge out the former favorite. Users are also able to delete favorites that fall out of favor. Finally, users are able to click into other users profiles and see a given users list of favorite bands and albums.
